Name: an!me
Summary: an!me - better ongoing, android application
Description: |-
    Note: As of 2020-08-17, the source repo has been missing for a few days now, and the app is no longer on the play store. I'm adding NoSourceSince, removing it from updater, and moving the apk to the archive.

    Note: I have not checked antifeatures. I'm not bothering. The description does say that Firebase is being used for ads, so I'm adding ads, tracking, and nonfree.

    Note: This app seems to be under active development. Don't expect me to update the description, because I won't. Click the source code link to see if it's accurate.
